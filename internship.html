                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>My 5-month internship at HomeRenoGuru offered an incredible opportunity to gain hands-on experience in website content management, digital marketing and user engagement strategies. I contributed to structuring and organizing content in a way that improved the website’s clarity and accessibility, while also creating visual assets to enhance engagement on digital platforms.

                        <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                        <p>As an intern, I was responsible for several key tasks that contributed to the company’s digital marketing and content strategy:</p>

                <div class="overview-container">
                    <div class="normal">
                        <h3>Website & System Management</h3>
                        <p>I worked on managing HomeRenoGuru’s content database, ensuring accurate and structured uploads of interior design projects and homeowner reviews. By verifying and organizing project data, I contributed to maintaining a user-friendly browsing experience, allowing homeowners to easily explore design inspirations. Additionally, I ensured that the backend data (leads on Excel) was accurately reflected in the system, preventing inconsistencies that could impact business operations.</p>

                        <h3>Thumbnails for Articles</h3>
                        <p>I designed thumbnails for articles to ensure visual clarity and relevance to the interior design industry. Through iterative feedback, I improved my ability to apply branding elements, typography choices, and composition techniques to make the thumbnails more aligned with the company’s aesthetic.Below is an example of an early thumbnail I designed, followed by an improved version after refining the composition based on feedback.</p> 
                        <div class="my-projects-img">
                            <img src="./assets/thumbnail-one.png" alt="Thumbnail image">
                            <caption class="caption-project-text">(Fig. 1) Initial Thumbnail Concept</caption>
                        </div><br>
                        <p>The feedback I received was that it did not show enough relevance to the industry, so my mentor decided to takeover the thumbnail to show me an example, which I ensured to process and learn from. I observed that there had been an inclusion of the company's logo, a project picture done by one of the interior design firms and lastly the use of better fonts and design elements.</p>

                        <h3>TikTok</h3>
                        <p>When I first worked on the company’s TikTok, I analyzed user interactions and identified low engagement due to inconsistent posting and a lack of strong brand identity.
                        To enhance the platform’s relevance, I implemented engagement-driven strategies, encouraging interaction with posts while also experimenting with content formats that resonated more with homeowners. Additionally, I helped create video content that aligned with the company’s brand aesthetic, ensuring consistency in style and messaging across platforms.</p>

                        <p>Some of the things I have done to increase awareness of the company's presence was to ask homeowners to follow our account and like the videos as this would boost the algorithm and would appear to the target audience's For-You-Page (FYP).</p>
                        <div class="my-projects-img">

                        </div><br>
                        <p>As of today, I still help the company with their TikTok by going to newly renovated houses and taking clips and turning them into a Tiktok video, all on a freelance basis.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> I learned to be more confident in unfamiliar situations, such as visiting homeowners and filming their spaces. At first, it felt intimidating, but over time, I became more comfortable engaging with them, adapting on the spot, and ensuring a smooth filming process.</li>

                        <li>Beyond just work, I discovered how much a strong team dynamic matters. The company had a welcoming and supportive culture, and I formed genuine connections, even gaining a close friend. This experience showed me the value of a positive work environment where people genuinely support one another</li>

                        <li>I realized that growth comes from taking on challenges that feel uncomfortable at first. Moving forward, I want to be bolder in stepping into unfamiliar roles because, as they say, "If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room."</li>
