                        <h3>Website & System Management</h3>
                        <p>I worked on managing HomeRenoGuru’s content database, ensuring accurate and structured uploads of interior design projects and homeowner reviews. By verifying and organizing project data, I contributed to maintaining a user-friendly browsing experience, allowing homeowners to easily explore design inspirations. Additionally, I ensured that the backend data (leads on Excel) was accurately reflected in the system, preventing inconsistencies that could impact business operations.</p>

                        <h3>Thumbnails for Articles</h3>
                        <p>I designed thumbnails for articles to ensure visual clarity and relevance to the interior design industry. Through iterative feedback, I improved my ability to apply branding elements, typography choices, and composition techniques to make the thumbnails more aligned with the company’s aesthetic.Below is an example of an early thumbnail I designed, followed by an improved version after refining the composition based on feedback.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> I learned to be more confident in unfamiliar situations, such as visiting homeowners and filming their spaces. At first, it felt intimidating, but over time, I became more comfortable engaging with them, adapting on the spot, and ensuring a smooth filming process.</li>

                        <li>Beyond just work, I discovered how much a strong team dynamic matters. The company had a welcoming and supportive culture, and I formed genuine connections, even gaining a close friend. This experience showed me the value of a positive work environment where people genuinely support one another</li>

                        <li>I realized that growth comes from taking on challenges that feel uncomfortable at first. Moving forward, I want to be bolder in stepping into unfamiliar roles because, as they say, "If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room."</li>
